## Variables


``` python 
a = "Hello World"
```
> Variables are commonly used in programming. It is similar to algebra where a value is assigned to a name.

> Assigning a value to variable is mandatory in python, however, it may differ for different languages

When we call the variable name, the terminal will output its value.

>e.g
> ``` python 
> # calling of variable
> print (a)
>```
>
> ``` console
> $ terminal output
> > Hello World
>```
